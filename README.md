## About

This is my first project in React, a simple task manager that I use whenever I have to sketch the steps for developing a project. Recommended to be opened with Chrome or Edge.


## Features
- Using the local storage, the users can add/remove/set tasks to low/high priority or mark them as complete. 
- A progress bar is filled when the user delegates a task.
- The user can navigate between the tasks by toggling the accordion menu. The accordion is from [ReachUI](https://reach.tech/)
- The app calls the API from https://icanhazdadjoke.com/ to display a joke as a reward when the user completes a task. Unfortunately, the API has downtime sometimes.



Thanks to [Cassidy Williams](https://twitter.com/cassidoo/) for the idea. She made the desktop app called [todometer](https://cassidoo.github.io/todometer/).
